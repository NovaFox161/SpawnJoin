SpawnJoin

This plugin adds much needed commands and multi world spawn handling. SpawnJoin provides hub, warp, lobby, home, spawn, and more.
It is designed to server as the sole teleportation managing plugin for servers both big and small.

This plugin will eventually be phased out and only bug fixes will be committed. Why? well, the project was made a long time ago, and due to me being a new developer at the time, the project uses messy code and bad conventions making it extremely hard to manage unless I do a complete rewrite.
